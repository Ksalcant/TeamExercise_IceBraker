it was a clear day in Raesfeld and the sun was very very warm.
It was great day for a Bratwurst.
After eating the Bratwurst the day could only get better with a drive in a Porsche 
I made my way to the Biergarten.
Then I decided to go to Berlin.
In Berlin, I attended a Rammstein concert.
All of a sudden, a Hund came driving on a BMW and gave me a ride to Schloss Eltz. 
When I got there, I stopped by the Ratskeller to grab a quick drink and bite to eat.
I quickly left when I noticed things were getting a little wettbewerbsfähig between the folks there.
Lastly, I went to go stop by the nearest Bäckerei for Gebäck.
The food wasn't to my liking so the owner offered me an apfelkuchen on the house!
